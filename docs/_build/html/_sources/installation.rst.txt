Stable release
--------------

To install the `mcimageprocessing` package through pip using a `setup.py` file, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Package Source Code**

First, you need to have the source code on your local machine. You can clone the source code using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/mc-t4d/imageprocessing.git

Alternatively, download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it to a directory on your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Package Directory**

Make sure you are in the directory containing the `setup.py` file this should be in the base folder of the cloned repo. 
This file contains the package metadata and dependencies needed for installation. 
Run the following command in your terminal if you are not already in the base folder:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd imageprocessing

3. **Install the Package**

Use `pip` to install the package. Run the following command to install the package along with its dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install .


If you prefer to install the package in "editable" mode (useful for development purposes), where changes to the source code will immediately affect the installed package, use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -e .


4. **Verify the Installation**

After installation, you can verify that the package is installed correctly by checking its presence in the list of installed packages:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip list | grep mcimageprocessing


This command should list `mcimageprocessing` along with its version, indicating that the package is installed.

In order to decrypt the configuration file, you will need to ensure openssl is installed on your machine.  If it is not, you can install it using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    linux: $ sudo apt-get install openssl
    mac: $ brew install openssl
    windows: $ download the installer from the [official website](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)

then run the following command to decrypt the configuration file:

.. code-block:: console

    linux: $ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in mcimageprocessing/config/config.enc -out mcimageprocessing/config/config.yaml -k [decryption key provided by T4D]
    mac: $ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in mcimageprocessing/config/config.enc -out mcimageprocessing/config/config.yaml -k [decryption key provided by T4D]
    windows: $ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in mcimageprocessing/config/config.enc -out mcimageprocessing/config/config.yaml -k [decryption key provided by T4D]

This will create a _config.yaml_ file in the _config_ directory that you can use to store your API keys, pre-populated with the keys provided by T4D.

5. **Testing the Installation**

You can test whether the package is working properly by running some of its functions or scripts. If the package provides a command-line interface or scripts, try executing them to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

6. **Updating the Package**

If the source code of the package is updated, you can upgrade the installed package by navigating to the package directory and running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --upgrade .
